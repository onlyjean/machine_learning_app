# Full-Stack Machine Learning Web Application

## Introduction
This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates the integration of machine learning models into a web interface. It utilises a React frontend to provide users with interactive predictions based on input data. This application is designed to showcase how machine learning models can be deployed effectively to make predictions on stock market prices.
